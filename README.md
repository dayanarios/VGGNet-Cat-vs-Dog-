# VGGNet Cat vs Dog Image Classifier

The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with deep learning models. I am attempting to complete
a past [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/overview), all training data is taken directly from their site. I will be implementing VGGNet Architecture with 16 layers and using Keras with Tensorflow running in the backend.

## Getting Started
Download the following [data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data) and store it in a seperate folder named 'data'

## To Do
1. Set up the VGG architecture to learn from the training data
2. Test the learning model and achieve a learning accuracy above 90%
